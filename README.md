# 0G Storage

## Overview

0G Storage is a decentralized data storage system designed to address the challenges of high-throughput and low-latency data storage and retrieval, particularly for areas such as AI. 

## System Architecture

0G Storage consists of two main components:

1. **Data Publishing Lane**: Ensures fast Merkle tree data root commitment and verification through 0G Chain.
2. **Data Storage Lane**: Manages large data transfers and storage using an erasure-coding mechanism for redundancy and sharding for parallel processing.

Across the two lanes, 0G Storage supports the following features:

* **General Purpose Design**: Supports atomic transactions, mutable key-value stores, and archive log systems, enabling a wide range of applications with various data types.
* **Validated Incentivization**: Utilizes the PoRA (Proof of Random Access) mining algorithm to mitigate the data outsourcing issue and to ensure rewards are distributed to nodes who contribute to the storage network.
